2022-07-18,-1,0,False,-,Transcription profiling of mouse cell types and tissues (GNF/Novartis),The tissue-specific pattern of mRNA expression can indicate important clues about gene function. High-density oligonucleotide arrays offer the opportunity to examine patterns of gene expression on a genome scale. Toward this end- we have designed custom arrays that interrogate the expression of the vast majority of protein-encoding human and mouse genes and have used them to profile a panel of 79 human and 61 mouse tissues. The resulting data set provides the expression patterns for thousands of predicted genes- as well as known and poorly characterized genes- from mice and humans. We have explored this data set for global trends in gene expression- evaluated commonly used lines of evidence in gene prediction methodologies- and investigated patterns indicative of chromosomal organization of transcription.
