The ontology covers all cell lines from major sources like ATCC- DSMZ- ECACC- ICLC etc. and is built in OWL format.,http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/1541,True,1.0,68,0.746,0.037,-,20689,bioportalmccl,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,nan,Not provided,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,0.00018449217054851785,endpoint absent,Name: BioPortal project on behalf of ontology owner.; Email:support@bioontology.org,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,Web:http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/1541 Name:Usha Mahadevan Email:Absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,insufficient data,insufficient data,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,0.30,6160,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,False,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,insufficient data,0.365,13.77,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,True
