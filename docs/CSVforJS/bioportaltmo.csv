The ontology should enable silos in discovery research- hypothesis management- experimental studies- compounds- formulation- drug development- market size- competitive data- population data- etc. to be brought together. This would enable scientists to answer new questions- and to answer existing scientific questions more quickly. This will help pharmaceutical companies to model patient-centric information- which is essential for the tailoring of drugs- and for early detection of compounds that may have sub-optimal safety profiles.
