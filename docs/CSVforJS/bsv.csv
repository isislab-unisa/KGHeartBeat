This dataset is an open archive of PHB published after 2009.The dataset is one result of the french project untitled VESPA (Value and optimization of epidemiosurveillance devices in a sustainable crop protection strategy) leading by INRA.A PHB is an information document- both technical and regulatory in nature- written under the responsibility of a regional epidemiological surveillance committee. A PHB gathers information about the health status of crops. It first presents pest risk analysis- and it is also used to disseminate regulatory information (mandatory control order- national notes- regulation evolution- etc.) and non-regulatory information (description of pest biology or prophylactic methods- such as management of intercropping- tillage- choice of cultivars- etc.).To access PHB a french thesaurus has been developed called FrenchCropUsage.
