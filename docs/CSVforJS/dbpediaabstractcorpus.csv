2022-07-18,-1,1,Creative Commons Attribution - cc-by -,-,DBpedia abstract corpus,This corpus contains a conversion of Wikipedia abstracts in six languages (dutch- english- french- german- italian and spanish) into the I used the NLP Interchange Format (NIF). The corpus contains the abstract texts- as well as the position- surface form and linked article of all links in the text. As such- it contains entity mentions manually disambiguated to Wikipedia/DBpedia resources by native speakers- which predestines it for NER training and evaluation.Furthermore- the abstracts represent a special form of text that lends itself to be used for more sophisticated tasks- like open relation extraction. Their encyclopedic style- following Wikipedia guidelines on opening paragraphs adds further interesting properties. The first sentence puts the article in broader context. Most anaphers will refer to the original topic of the text- making them easier to resolve. Finally- should the same string occur in different meanings- Wikipedia guidelines suggest that the new meaning should again be linked for disambiguation. In short: The type of text is highly interesting.Acknowledgments: The conversion of this corpus was supported by the [FREME H2020 project](http://www.freme-project.eu/).,Absent,False,0.5,1,0,0.001,-,743532157,dbpediaabstractcorpus,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,nan,http://downloads.dbpedia.org/2015-04/ext/nlp/abstracts/nl/leipzig_nl.ttl; http://downloads.dbpedia.org/2015-04/ext/nlp/abstracts/en/leipzig_en.ttl; http://downloads.dbpedia.org/2015-04/ext/nlp/abstracts/fr/leipzig_fr.ttl; http://downloads.dbpedia.org/2015-04/ext/nlp/abstracts/de/leipzig_de.ttl; http://downloads.dbpedia.org/2015-04/ext/nlp/abstracts/it/leipzig_it.ttl; http://downloads.dbpedia.org/2015-04/ext/nlp/abstracts/es/leipzig_es.ttl; http://downloads.dbpedia.org/2015-04/ext/nlp/abstracts/ja/leipzig_ja.ttl,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,0.01372342955785265,endpoint absent,Name: Martin Brümmer; Email:bruemmer@informatik.uni-leipzig.de,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,Web:Absent Name:Martin Brümmer Email:bruemmer@informatik.uni-leipzig.de,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,insufficient data,insufficient data,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,0.11,82318744,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,False,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,insufficient data,0.48,44.76,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,False

2022-10-16,-1,1,Creative Commons Attribution - cc-by -,-,DBpedia abstract corpus,This corpus contains a conversion of Wikipedia abstracts in six languages (dutch- english- french- german- italian and spanish) into the I used the NLP Interchange Format (NIF). The corpus contains the abstract texts- as well as the position- surface form and linked article of all links in the text. As such- it contains entity mentions manually disambiguated to Wikipedia/DBpedia resources by native speakers- which predestines it for NER training and evaluation.Furthermore- the abstracts represent a special form of text that lends itself to be used for more sophisticated tasks- like open relation extraction. Their encyclopedic style- following Wikipedia guidelines on opening paragraphs adds further interesting properties. The first sentence puts the article in broader context.
