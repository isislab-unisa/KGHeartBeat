Language Source Description This diachronic ontology is constructed from People's Daily of fifty years (i.e.- from 1947 to 1996). The ontology for each year is consisted with several concept trees and we only consider words with frequencies not lower than 100 in each year. Numerals- punctuations- non-morpheme words- quantifiers and function words are excluded. In addition- we have subjectively defined eight eras of consecutive years. The ontology for each era only includes words with frequencies over 300 for each period.
