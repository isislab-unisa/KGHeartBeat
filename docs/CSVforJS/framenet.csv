The aim is to document the range of semantic and syntactic combinatory possibilities (valences) of each word in each of its senses- through computer-assisted annotation of example sentences and automatic tabulation and display of the annotation results. The major product of this work- the FrameNet lexical database- currently contains more than 10-000 lexical units (defined below)- more than 6-100 of which are fully annotated- in more than 825 semantic frames- exemplified in more than 135-000 annotated sentences. It has gone through three releases- and is now in use by hundreds of researchers- teachers- and students around the world (see FrameNet Users). Active research projects are now seeking to produce comparable frame-semantic lexicons for other languages and to devise means of automatically labeling running text with semantic frame information.### OpennessNot open.
