The 2011 GHI is the sixth in an annual series that records the state of global- regional- and national hunger.The GHI captures three dimensions of hunger: insufficient availability of calories- shortfalls in the nutritional status of children- and child mortality. Accordingly- the Index includes the following three equally weighted indicators: the proportion of people who are undernourished- as estimated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); the prevalence of underweight in children under the age of five- as compiled by the World Health Organization (WHO); and the under-five mortality rate- as reported by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). The 2011 index includes GHI values for four time periods- recalculated using the latest source data- to allow an exploration of change over time. ,http://www.ifpri.org/publication/2011-global-hunger-index,False,0.75,1,0,0.001,-,19369,globalhungerindex2011,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,nan,Not provided,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,8.134453402854012e-05,endpoint absent,Name: Tim Davies; Email:tim@practicalparticipation.co.uk,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,Web:http://www.ifpri.org/publication/2011-global-hunger-index Name:International Food Policy Research Institute Email:ifpri@cgiar.org,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,insufficient data,insufficient data,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,0.01,260,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,False,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,insufficient data,0.338,44.74,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,True

The 2011 GHI is the sixth in an annual series that records the state of global- regional- and national hunger.The GHI captures three dimensions of hunger: insufficient availability of calories- shortfalls in the nutritional status of children- and child mortality. Accordingly- the Index includes the following three equally weighted indicators: the proportion of people who are undernourished- as estimated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); the prevalence of underweight in children under the age of five- as compiled by the World Health Organization (WHO); and the under-five mortality rate- as reported by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). The 2011 index includes GHI values for four time periods- recalculated using the latest source data- to allow an exploration of change over time. ,http://www.ifpri.org/publication/2011-global-hunger-index,False,0.75,1,0,0.001,-,19369,globalhungerindex2011,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,nan,Not provided,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,8.134453402854012e-05,endpoint absent,Name: Tim Davies; Email:tim@practicalparticipation.co.uk,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,Web:http://www.ifpri.org/publication/2011-global-hunger-index Name:International Food Policy Research Institute Email:ifpri@cgiar.org,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,insufficient data,insufficient data,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,0.01,260,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,False,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,insufficient data,0.338,12.75,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,True
