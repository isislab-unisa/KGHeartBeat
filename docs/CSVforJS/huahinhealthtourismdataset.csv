In this work we design the ontology focused on these four categories.•	Hotel and resort spa: a spa located within a resort or hotel providing wellness components.•	Destination spa: a facility with the main purpose is guided individual spa-goers to develop their healthy habits. •	Day spa: a spa offers to clients a variety of professionally administered spa services on a day-use basis.•	Medical spa: a spa poses an on-site source of natural mineral- thermal or seawater used in hydrotherapy treatments.Please use this to cite our data set:Choksuchat- C.; Ngamphak- S.; Maneesaeng- B.; Chiwpreechar- Y.; Chantrapornchai- C.- ""Parallel health tourism information extraction and ontology storage-"" Computer Science and Software Engineering (JCSSE)- 2014 11th International Joint Conference on - vol.- no.- pp.236-241- 14-16 May 2014doi: 10.1109/JCSSE.2014.6841873",Absent,absent,0.5,[],{},nan,-,0,huahinhealthtourismdataset,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,nan,Not provided,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,-,-,endpoint absent,-,-,-,endpoint absent,Name: chantana chantrapornchai; chidchanok choksuchat; Email:fengcnc@ku.ac.th; cchoksuchat@hotmail.com,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,Web:Absent Name:chantana chantrapornchai Email:fengcnc@ku.ac.th,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,-,-,insufficient data,insufficient data,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,0,0,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,False,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,insufficient data,0.325,12.26,-,-,endpoint absent,endpoint absent,True
