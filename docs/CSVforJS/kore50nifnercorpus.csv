The dataset aims to capture hard to disambiguate mentions of entities and it contains a large number of first names referring to persons- whose identity needs to be deduced from the given context. It comprises 50 sentences from different domains- such as music- celebrities- and business and is provided in a clear TSV format.The corpus was converted to NLP Interchange Format (NIF).[1] J.
