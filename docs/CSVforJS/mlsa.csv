Therefore- it is either objective or subjective.The second dimension covers the semantic orientation of the sentence- i.e. itspolarity. Thus- it is either positive- negative or neutral.In the second layer- we model the contextually interpreted sentiments on thelevels of words and NP/PP phrases. That is- the annotation decisionsare based on the meaning of the words in the context of the sentence.Word sentiment markers:The sentiments on the level of individual words are expressed bysingle character markers added at the end of the words.A word might be positive (+)- negative(-)- neutral(empty)- a shifter(~)- an intensifier (^)- or a diminisher (%).If a word ends with a hyphen (e.g.- ""auf beziehungs-_ bzw.partnerschaftliche Probleme-""- an underscore is added to the word inorder to prevent missinterpretations of the hyphen as a negativemarker.Currently- only words that are part of an NP/PP are marked withsentiment markers. Annotated words are nouns- adjectives- negationparticles- prepositions- adverbs.The world level annotation was done by 3 persons individually. Theindividual results were harmonized into a single reference annotation.Phrase level markers:Each phrase is marked up textually by brackets- e.g. ""[aufbeziehungs-_ bzw. partnerschaftliche Probleme-]"". The type of a phrase(NP/PP) is not written to the brackets. We follow largely theannotation model of TIGER for structuring embedded NPs and PPs.Currently- the following limitations with regard to TIGER exist: (1)Adjectival phrases are not marked up (2) Relative or infinitivalsentences are not included in NPs/PPs if they appear at the end of aphrase or if the are discontiguous. We do not only annotate thephrases which immediately contain words that are marked up as polar.Any dependent subphrase (NP/PP) is integrated into all its dominatingNPs/PPs- e.g. ""[Die tieferen Ursachen [der Faszination+]]"". Dependentsubphrases without any polar words are also included- however- thereis no internal bracketing for them- e.g. ""[hohe+ Anspr체che an Qualit채tund Lage]""At the level of phrases- we distinguish the following markers:positive (+)- negative (-)- neutral(0)- bipolar (#). The category'bipolar' is used mainly for coordinations where negative and positivesentiments of something are kept in balance by the writer. This isquite common for a lot of binomial constructions as ""Krieg undFrieden"".",http://iggsa.sentimental.li/index.php/downloads/,absent,0.75,4,0,0.002,-,21000,mlsa,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,http://mlode.nlp2rdf.org/sparql,Not provided,-,-,-,endpoint offline,-,-,-,-,endpoint offline,-,-,0.00015777186250409448,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,Web:http://iggsa.sentimental.li/index.php/downloads/ Name:  Interest Group on German Sentiment Analysis (IGGSA) Email:iggsa@sentimental.li,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,-,-,insufficient data,insufficient data,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,0.40,8490,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,True,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,insufficient data,0.357,13.47,-,-,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,True
