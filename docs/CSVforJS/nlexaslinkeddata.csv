All national databases offer a non-standardized access to their data- which in all cases is HTML or worse (e.g. PDF documents). Given the fact- that there are also no dumps of raw data (e.g. CSV) available- there is no unified N-LEX dataset that can be converted and published as Linked Data. Rather each countries legislation database has to be treated as an autonomous dataset. Thus we have chosen one country- namely Germany and converted this database into Linked Data via scraping.,http://n-lex.publicdata.eu/,True,1.0,1,0,0.001,-,1792054,nlexaslinkeddata,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,http://n-lex.publicdata.eu/sparql,Not provided,-,-,-,endpoint offline,-,-,-,-,endpoint offline,-,-,8.129012957707683e-05,endpoint offline,Name: Agile Knowledge and Semantic Web Research Group (AKSW); Email:aksw@informatik.uni-leipzig.de,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,Web:http://n-lex.publicdata.eu/ Name:Philipp Frischmuth Email:frischmuth@informatik.uni-leipzig.de,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,-,-,insufficient data,insufficient data,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,0.00,2,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,False,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,insufficient data,0.4,15.09,-,-,endpoint offline,endpoint offline,False

It offers a unified search form to national legislation databases- a multilingual dictionary (EUROVOC) as well as a context-sensitive help. The project started with 4 national databases and has grown to 23 databases today.Besides the unified search form (which is not very useful for extraction purposes)- the website also contains links to the respective national websites of the databases.
