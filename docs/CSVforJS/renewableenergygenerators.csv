2022-07-18,0,1,Creative Commons CCZero - cc-zero -,-,Renewable Energy Generators,The Renewable Energy Federation maintains an online database of renewable energy generators located in the United Kingdom. The dataset consists of over 5500 generators around the UK- including both on-shore and off-shore installations. The generators have all been categorized based on type and many of them include details of their address- geographic location- and details of the organizations that developed- operate- or own the site. Some wind turbine installations also include details on the number- size and type of turbines.*Note* this dataset is no longer updated- it was taken off-line during the shutdown of Kasabi.
