TERENCE dataset includes a collection of narrative stories especially created for (hearing and hearing-impaired) children in the age of 7 to 11 years- who have poor reading comprehension skills. The stories are associated with some reasoning tasks about the story characters and events in the form of multiple-choice questions.The collection of stories and reasoning tasks is used for performing intervention therapy plans in class to assess and stimulate children's abilities to comprehend texts. In particular- the tasks focus on fostering inference-making skills and reasoning about temporal and causal relations between story events.The stories are provided in four different levels of complexity.

TERENCE dataset includes a collection of narrative stories especially created for (hearing and hearing-impaired) children in the age of 7 to 11 years- who have poor reading comprehension skills. The stories are associated with some reasoning tasks about the story characters and events in the form of multiple-choice questions.The collection of stories and reasoning tasks is used for performing intervention therapy plans in class to assess and stimulate children's abilities to comprehend texts. In particular- the tasks focus on fostering inference-making skills and reasoning about temporal and causal relations between story events.The stories are provided in four different levels of complexity.
