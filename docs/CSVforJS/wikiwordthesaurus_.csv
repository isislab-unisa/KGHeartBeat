It was originally developed for a diploma thesis at the University of Leipzig. Development is continued by Wikimedia Deutschland.Note: only extracts for specific topics are available for download right now. This is due mainly to the sheer size of the dump files. Full SQL dumps are available upon request. For the next release- we plan to make full RDF dumps available again.### UpdatesThe original thesaurus was created in 2008- using data from late 2007.
