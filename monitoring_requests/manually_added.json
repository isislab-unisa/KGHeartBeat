It is openly accessible via: (i) The ARIADNE portal (https://portal.ariadne-infrastructure.eu/) that is backed by an OpenSearch index server; (ii) A GraphDB instance, that can be queried via a web graphical user interface or programmatically with SPARQL queries (free registration to the ARIADNEplus_Lab Virtual Research Environment required). The Knowledge Base is accompanied by documentation in the form of a Jupyter Notebook, allowing users to get acquainted with the API and the data model thanks to code that can be run live on the GraphDB instance."
